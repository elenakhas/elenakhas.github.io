        		<h1>Hi! I am Elena. I am a master's student in Computational Linguistics and a member of <a href="https://clmbr.shane.st lab.">CLMBR research group.</a></h1>
				<p> My journey in NLP and Computational linguistics started from learning to code by myself and then studying Natural Language Processing at University of Lorraine (Nancy, France) and was an intern at <a href="https://synalp.loria.fr/">SYNALP team at LORIA.</a></p>
    		<p> Before going back to graduate school and moving countries, I have been teaching foreign languages for almost a decade as a Fulbright Language Teaching Assistant at University of New Haven (CT, USA),
        lecturer at Business Foreign Languages department at Saint Petersburg State University (Russia), and various language schools.
        I did research in conceptual semantics, cognitive linguistics, Siberian dialectology and discourse analysis.
        These days, I am excited about the potential of technology to generate insights about human languages, and the ways these insights can help Education.
